The project maintains a history of every chemical asset's movement throughout the university from its procurement through its distribution, use, and disposal. It also provides the capacity to look up the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) information associated with each chemical, as well as the ability to generate reports on individual assets or aggregate data.","The system is built utilizing the Laravel PHP framework to provide a easily navigable user interface. This interface interacts with a MySQL database, via Laravel's PDO driver. It also harnesses the power of AJAX to facilitate the dynamic loading of content. The project was developed following a substantial design process, including the generation of a highly detailed specification and preliminary UI design.","Unfortunately, the project's codebase is owned by the university and not publicly available.

It centered around a Raspberry Pi, which ran a minimized linux operating system. The project code was authored in C++, and consisted of a number of subsystems responsible for various portions of the system's operation. The project harnessed a number of publicly available libraries to perform image processing and hardware interfaces, including the OpenCV library.","On the hardware side, the project required the use of an infrared camera, as well as a photogate with custom logic to convert its output to values appropriate for the Raspberry Pi's GPIO interface. It also required the design and manufacturing of several custom hardware mounts to affix the system components to the printer."],actions:[{link:"https://github.com/sdonchez/SeniorDesign",text:"Visit the project Github Repo"}],icon:"PrintCheck3D.jpg",avatarSquare:!0,Alt:"Picture of a 3D printer monitored by PrintCheck3D"},{title:"HKA Database Management System",subtitle1:"Hoover Karate Academy",slug:"HKADB",text:["One of my earliest major development projects, the HKA Database Management System was designed in response to a drastic need for improvement to the school's pre-existing system for tracking student records.
