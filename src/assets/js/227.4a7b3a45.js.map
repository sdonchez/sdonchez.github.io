The project maintains a history of every chemical asset's movement throughout the university from its procurement through its distribution, use, and disposal.

For our capstone project, my team worked to implement what became the PrintCheck3D system, a system that monitored the college's fleet of 3D Printers to detect failed printjobs, and took action on those failures in order to preserve the print where possible, and otherwise to stop the print in order to prevent damage to the printer or the waste of additional consumable resources.\",\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"The project required, like most embedded systems, a fusion of hardware and software work. It centered around a Raspberry Pi, which ran a minimized linux operating system. The project code was authored in C++, and consisted of a number of subsystems responsible for various portions of the system's operation. The project harnessed a number of publicly available libraries to perform image processing and hardware interfaces, including the OpenCV library.\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"On the hardware side, the project required the use of an infrared camera, as well as a photogate with custom logic to convert its output to values appropriate for the Raspberry Pi's GPIO interface. It also required the design and manufacturing of several custom hardware mounts to affix the system components to the printer.\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactions:[\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlink: \"https://github.com/sdonchez/SeniorDesign\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext: \"Visit the project Github Repo\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\t\t\ticon: \"PrintCheck3D.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavatarSquare: true,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlt: \"Picture of a 3D printer monitored by PrintCheck3D\"\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttitle: \"HKA Database Management System\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubtitle1: \"Hoover Karate Academy\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslug: \"HKADB\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttext: [\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"One of my earliest major development projects, the HKA Database Management System was designed in response to a drastic need for improvement to the school's pre-existing system for tracking student records.
