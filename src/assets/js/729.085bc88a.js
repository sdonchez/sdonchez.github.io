In this role, I aided in the development of embedded software across all phases of the design process, from operating environment configuration to application development to testing and authoring documentation.","I returned to Harris the following summer as a systems engineering intern, and performed extensive work conducting a risk management analysis of an electronic warfare (EW) system. I also assisted the software team by authoring and performing a number of unit and regression tests on several EW systems to aid in certifying equipment prior to its release, as well as testing several options for operating environment configuration and deployment automation. On a more traditional systems engineering note, I also aided in the production of design documentation for a new EW platform.","In the summer of 2020, I returned once again to L3Harris (rebranded as the result of a merger) as a systems engineering intern. This year, I served in a much more hands on role, spending a lot of time in the lab assisting in efforts to integrate a next generation EW system. In the course of this work, I participated in a wide variety of tests and processes, including conducting comprehensive reviews of vendor designs and participating in design reviews. I continued in this role part time throughout the 2020-2021 academic year, full time in the summer of 2021, and resumed work in a part time capacity for the 2021-2022 academic year.","Following the completion of my master's degree in May of 2022, I transitioned  back to a full time role with L3Harris, this time in their Integrated Mission Systems segment, and specifically as a cleared systems engineer within their Cyber Systems business.

Notable events VUTC provides services for include the freshman orientation program, Special Olympics Fall Festival (the largest student run special olympics event in the world), NOVAdance (a 12 hour dance marathon to benefit pediatric cancer patients), and A Capella Palooza (a student A Capella showcase featuring full concert-style production).","My first leadership position in VUTC was in the spring of my freshman year. At that time, I began serving as VUTC's Events Manager, a role which required me to meet with clients, determine their needs, generate and provide them with a quote, and coordinate logistic for each event.
